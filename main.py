# REQUIREMENTS
#
# Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to
# exactly match content of the source folder;
#
# Synchronization should be performed periodically;
#
# File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output;
#
# Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments;
#
# It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization;
#
# It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorithms. For example,
# there is no point in implementing yet another function that calculates MD5 if you need it for the task â€“ it is
# perfectly acceptable to use a third-party (or built-in) library.
